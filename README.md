U.S State Guessing Game using GUI Application - Tkinter

This app is great for learning!
  - User must enter any state's name (the user input will be automatically converted to .title()) so it doesn't matter if enter the text in lower or uppercase.
  
  - User must enter the correct spelling of the state's name or else it will be deemed as wrong and must re-enter their answer again.
  
  - When the user is stuck and can no longer think of any other state's name, then they can type the word "exit," and the program will end and generate a csv file called "states_to_learn.csv" that will contain all of the states name the user did not guess.
